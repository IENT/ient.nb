Functionality to enhance Jupyter Notebooks IENT style

## Contents

* `ient_plots.py` offers to style Matplotlib axes the IENT way (e.g. with arrows below the axes) as well as the RWTH colors
* `ient_signals.py` consists of common signal definitions in NumPy
* `ient_tikzmagic.py` defines a magic command to compile TikZ within a notebook (forked from https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic)

## Usage

Visit the notebook [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) for a table of contents.

* Run the interactive notebooks directly with binder:

  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgit.rwth-aachen.de%2FIENT%2Fient.nb/62ca8f153839fc321194fd89cee975748d69b2b2?filepath=index.ipynb)

* Clone (or download as Zip) this repository with git and open the notebooks locally on your PC with Jupyter ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is highly recommended for this).
